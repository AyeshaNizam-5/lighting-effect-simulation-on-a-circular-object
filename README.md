# lighting-effect-simulation-on-a-circular-object
there is a black planet and three light sources (red, green and blue) rotating in different orbits around the planet. the color effect is showed on the planet.
Created a Flower using polar and vector form of equation.
you can use f1,f2,f3 to turn on or off the lights and the see the effect of active lights on the planet. you can stop their rotation with f4 keys. f5 is used to restart the entire simulation.
